On Wednesday, [Mozilla introduced legal updates to users of Firefox](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/firefox-news/firefox-terms-of-use/), and something feels off. I read, and re-read the new [Terms of Use](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/legal/terms/firefox/) and while much of it reads like standard boilerplate from any tech company, there's a new section that doesn't seem normal:

> When you upload or input information through Firefox, you hereby grant us a nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license to use that information to help you navigate, experience, and interact with online content as you indicate with your use of Firefox.

The community [has](https://mastodon.social/@jomo@mstdn.io/114072136832770185) [also](https://mastodon.social/@mttaggart@infosec.exchange/114071999430250354) [zeroed](https://www.reddit.com/r/firefox/comments/1iyuvjf/introducing_a_terms_of_use_and_updated_privacy/meyb9e9/) in on this phrase, with contributors [asking directly](https://discourse.mozilla.org/t/why-does-mozilla-now-require-a-nonexclusive-royalty-free-worldwide-license-when-entering-information-in-firefox/140700) [what up with that?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqpnRyfz_aY)

While I'm not going to ponder about *why* Mozilla wants this royalty-free license to my intellectual property, I immediately wondered whether using Microsoft Word also needed this kind of license grant -- since it is *processing my words*.

I was quickly [informed](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/servicesagreement) by a chatroom interlocutor that:

>To the extent necessary to provide the Services to you and others, to protect you and the Services, and to improve Microsoft products and services, you grant to Microsoft a worldwide and royalty-free intellectual property license to use Your Content, for example, to make copies of, retain, transmit, reformat, display, and distribute via communication tools Your Content on the Services.

which definitely feels sketchy. However, this copy is part of a section called "Your Content" where Microsoft explicitly disclaims ownership of your content:

> Many of our Services allow you to create, store or share Your Content or receive material from others. **We don’t claim ownership of Your Content.** Your Content remains yours and you are responsible for it.

If that gives you the ick, or you simply want to avoid the [ads coming to Office](https://beebom.com/microsoft-free-ad-supported-office-quietly-launched/), you may want to try [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) - which doesn't seem to have a terms of service. Just local, open source software.

Ultimately, Microsoft specifically disclaims ownership of your content - something Mozilla does not do.

Is Mozilla an outlier here? Is this as weird as it seems? Mozilla has a [browser comparison page](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/browsers/compare/), so we can use those as a basis for comparison - let's look at the data!

| Browser  |  Uploaded or input information grant a nonexclusive, royalty-free, worldwide license |  Notes |
|---|---|---|
| [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/legal/terms/firefox/)  | ✅  |    |
| [Google Chrome](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en-US)  |  ❌ | Google says that "your content remains yours, which means that you retain any intellectual property rights that you have in your content". They also retain the right to use "content you’ve shared publicly to promote" their service, such as reviews.  |
| [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/servicesagreement)  | ❌  | Microsoft grants itself a "worldwide and royalty-free intellectual property license to use Your Content, for example, to make copies of, retain, transmit, reformat, display, and distribute via communication tools Your Content on the Services" while explicitly disclaiming ownership of your content.  |
| [Apple Safari](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/data/en/safari/)  | ❌  | No reference to user generated intellectual property. Apple says that they retain "personal data only for so long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected".  |
| [Brave](https://brave.com/terms-of-use/)  | ❌  | No language about intellectual property licenses of user generated content.  |
| [Opera](https://www.opera.com/legal/terms)  |  ❌ |  No language about intellectual property licenses of user generated content |

It would be remiss to not mention that this comes at the heels of a [leadership shakeup](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/mozilla-leadership-growth-planning-updates/) at Mozilla, with the loss of its longtime [lizard wrangler, Mitchell Baker](https://www.politico.com/story/2014/10/getting-there-mozilla-foundations-mitchell-baker-111479) and a new focus on "[privacy-respecting advertising]({% post_url 2023-05-03-with-its-API-update-reddit-should-start-paying-its-users %})" and "trustworthy, open source AI".

The terms are clearly out of step with Firefox's most direct competition, so I hope that we'll see Mozilla correct course.
