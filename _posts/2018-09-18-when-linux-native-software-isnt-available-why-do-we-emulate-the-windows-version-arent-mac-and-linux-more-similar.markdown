# Original Post

> I’ve probably used a bunch of incorrect terms but please bear with me.

> I was just thinking from what I’ve gathered MacOS/OSX seems pretty similar to linux, and there are linux packages and stuff that have been ported over/works on MacOS that were originally designed for linux (stuff via homebrew for example). This made me wonder: would it be easier to somehow “emulate”/port over Mac versions of software vs Windows?

## My Comments

If more work were put into [GNUstep](https://gnustep.github.io/), more macOS software could be recompiled for GNUstep to run on Linux or BSD or whatever.

[Darling](https://www.darlinghq.org/) works on CLI apps (or used to last I checked), but doesn't work for the nice GUI apps that you might want to use. WINE, as mentioned by another poster, is mature and runs Windows binaries unmodified.

### Context

I had been both a Classic Mac OS and Mac OS X user before I moved to Linux, and I had used [Mail.app](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Mail) as my GUI mail client on OS X. While I most often used Thunderbird, I missed the lightweight Mac Mail app, and learned that NeXTMail had been forked to [GNUMail.app](https://mediawiki.gnustep.org/index.php/GNUMail.app), and that it was available for Linux. 

That led to learning about both GNUstep and [Étoilé](http://etoileos.com/), another stagnant project to bring NeXTSTEP and Mac OS functionality to an open source OS.

Unfortunately all of the projects seem to basically be at a standstill today.
