Hello fellow community,

so as the topic says i got some issues running dashlane in firefox. i already searched for related threads in this subreddit but it couldn't satisfy me.

So i just downloaded Dashlane and being a fan of firefox i wanted to add it. but the extension symbol keeps grey, no matter what i do. it isnt even clickable. first, i deinstalled the extension, then dashlane, then even firefox itself. but none of these things made it work. i then downloaded google chrome and it's works fine from the start.

so the reason of my post is obviously that i don't want to change my browser but i do not see a reason to use it any longer. but if some feller here around had the same experience but solved it i would be grateful if you could share it.

sincerely

Dashlane has problems everywhere from what I have read. I would recommend [Bitwarden](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/bitwarden-password-manager/) instead.
