> Firefox has gone through various changes, some controversial, over the course of over a decade. What is the primary or sole factor that makes you decide to stay with the fox in 2020?

"Quality" isn't an option, but that is my reason. It remains the best all around browser for me, it runs on all the OSes I care about, it is unique and not just a spin on Chromium, it is constantly improving, the developers are fairly responsive, it is 100% open source, and it is actually really really fast. 

I've run many browsers over the years, from Netscape to Cyberdog and iCab, Internet Explorer 5 (macOS), Mozilla (suite), Firefox/Phoenix, Camino, Safari - I keep coming back to Firefox because it has had a great mix of cross platform support (lacking in iCab, Cyberdog, Safari) and features that generally work pretty well.

Chromium is actually pretty good, but for whatever reason, it can't handle tab abuse as well as Firefox can, and it isn't a good platform citizen on Linux (weird scrollbars, for example). Chromium also has odd font smoothing and scrolling on Windows. Extensions still have more features on Firefox than in those browsers as well.
