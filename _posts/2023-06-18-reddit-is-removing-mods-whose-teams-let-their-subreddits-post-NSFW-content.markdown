Update: *The Verge* has now [posted about this](https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/20/23767848/reddit-blackout-api-protest-moderators-suspended-nsfw):

>“Moderators incorrectly marking a community as NSFW is a violation of both our Content Policy and Moderator Code of Conduct,” Reddit spokesperson Tim Rathschmidt said to The Verge. He declined to comment when asked if Reddit removed the mods.

Update #2: Less than an hour after the first update, Reddit seems to have put some of the teams back in place, (partially) backpedaling very quickly.

The whiplash from these latest moves is insane!

Update #3: *The Verge* also updated their story:

>While r/MildlyInteresting got its mods back, other newly NSFW subs that lost their mods Thursday still don’t have them. r/interestingasfuck (11 million subscribers), r/TIHI (1.7 million subscribers), and r/ShittyLifeProTips (1.6 million subscribers), which had all gone NSFW or loosened their rules, are currently unmoderated.

Things are moving fast again, so this is going to be another quick and dirty post... Reddit is now removing mod teams without any pretense of speaking for moderators.

In the newest front in the Reddit protest, subreddits had begun allowing NSFW content, in order to deprive Reddit of ad targeting opportunities for the subreddit.

Just a few minutes ago, the moderation teams for r/mildlyinteresting, r/interestingasfuck, and r/TIHI were mass removed.

u/Davis_Schina confirmed that they received this note from Reddit:

Moderators who want to retain control of their subreddits may want to restrict NSFW submissions again.
