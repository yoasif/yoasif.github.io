While drafting a post about how I see the legal changes [Mozilla introduced last week](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/products/firefox/firefox-news/firefox-terms-of-use/) affecting Firefox as a whole, I noticed another over-broad rights grant that Mozilla lays claim to in its new Tos: people's feedback.

In the new [ToS](https://www.mozilla.org/about/legal/terms/firefox/), Mozilla says:

> If you give Mozilla any ideas, suggestions, or feedback about the Services, you give Mozilla permission to use them for free and without any additional obligations.

While Mozilla didn't have a ToS prior to last week, their [About Your Rights](https://archive.ph/iLRyr) page had a line about feedback:

> Some features in Firefox, such as the Crash Reporter, give you the option to provide feedback to Mozilla. By choosing to submit feedback, you give Mozilla permission to use the feedback to improve its products, to publish the feedback on its websites, and to distribute the feedback.

Previously, Mozilla claimed the rights to your feedback when submitted directly to Mozilla. 

The new ToS extends that right to any ideas you "give" Mozilla as long as you also use Firefox.

I'm not a lawyer, but my naive reading of the clause supports the idea that I have given permission to Mozilla to the ideas in this blog post for free -- even though I am writing my ideas about Firefox in a text editor and posting them via Git -- because I *also* use Firefox.

A more obvious scenario might be if Mozilla claims that ideas people post to reddit are given to Mozilla for free -- because they are posted by Firefox users.

I think that is contrary to the way we expect these rights to be granted, and goes beyond the rights Mozilla claimed prior to last week. 

While I doubt many people are going to have much of an outcry about this (if you don't want Mozilla to have your ideas, don't use Firefox), it remains a needlessly over-broad permission granted to Mozilla, *simply by using Firefox*. 

Mozilla: Legally, this idea is free for you (but you already knew that): **Please scope this right to ideas, suggestions, or feedback *posted* or *sent* via Crash Reporter or to Mozilla properties.** Simply using the browser shouldn't grant such an over-broad right.
