I'm curious -- what do you disagree with on the [linked page](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/campaigns/eu-misinformation/)?

>After reading Firefox's tweets and some other sources, and it seems like Firefox is really trying to hinder people's right to speak.

FWIW, Firefox isn't Mozilla, and Mozilla isn't trying to hinder peoples right to speech, but they *are* concerned about misinformation.

Anyone that cares about facts also ought to be worried about people who believe things that just aren't true, because that is damaging to societies as a whole.

Mozilla gives money to Tor, so I don't think that there is any question that Mozilla is in favor of freedom of speech. The question is whether they are in favor of misinformation damaging societies.

> But what's considered misinformation? Isn't it anything that doesn't suit one's opinion?

No, maybe that is the problem in the way you are seeing it - since anything you don't agree with is "misinformation" in your mind, you may think that Facebook, et al will disagree with you and make misinformation go away.

That isn't what misinformation is. You can have different opinions about things, but opinions aren't misinformation.

False "facts" masquerading as truth is misinformation. An example might be most of the things on snopes. Not matters of opinion, just not true.

Did you read the page? It says nothing about censorship and only asks for increased

> transparency of political advertising on the platform to prevent abuse during the elections

Where do you see anything here about misinformation, even?

Also, why do you even care about Facebook? It's like the kiddie version of the internet. If you want freedom of speech, get a domain outside the control of countries that care about censorship and post whatever you want. Are people really using Facebook as a blogging platform and complaining if stuff gets removed? That is what they do!
