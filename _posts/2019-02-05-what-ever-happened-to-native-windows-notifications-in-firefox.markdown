# Original Post

> Mozilla announced they were working on it shortly after [Chrome introduced them early last summer](https://www.thurrott.com/windows/windows-10/165455/google-chrome-now-uses-native-windows-10-notifications). Where did they go? I could've sworn they said something about launching the feature in version 63 or 64

## My Comments

Watch bug id [1497425](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1497425 "Turn on Toast Notification on release channel").

When that ticket is closed, it will be in release. You can watch that ticket, along with the ones it blocks to be aware of when it will be released.
