**TL;DR**: On the [November 2025 Mozilla Support Community call](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/forums/contributors/717462), Mozilla provided updates on the recent controversy from the Japanese Support Mozilla community quitting over AI, calling it a "miscommunication" and "misinterpretation".

During the call, Mozilla also doubled down on AI, confirming that volunteers would be unable to disable AI translations across the entire Mozilla knowledge-base, with the American English version of articles serving as the blessed, canonical version. Locale specific contributions will be overwritten (by design) by AI.

This means that without human intervention, Mozilla intends to roll out automated AI slop across the entire knowledge-base, especially for archival content.

While writing about the intriduction of pervasive machine translation to Mozilla Support, I realized that I had some additional context about Mozilla that most readers would not. Mozilla recently posted a VP of Community job that I applied to. The hiring process included a take home "performance exercise" to give hiring managers a window into interviewees think.

The exercise included 7 scenarios to respond to. The scenarios seem to reflect real challenges that Mozilla is currently experiencing. 

One of the scenario is about the "volunteer burnout spiral" that the support community is experiencing.

Mozilla doubling down on forcing machine translation on their volunteer base, seems to be their response to the  that their community is experiening.

The scenario in full:

## Volunteer Burnout Spiral

Climate anxiety, surveillance fears, constant exposure to technology's harmful impacts… it’s all
taking a psychological toll on your most engaged members. People report feeling doomed and
helpless despite their activism. Worse, your top twenty volunteers are burning out in
spectacular fashion. They collectively do about 60% of the work that makes your community
function. They are sending you messages that make your stomach drop:

* “I feel used.”
* “I love Mozilla but I can't keep doing unpaid labor while staff get salaries and benefits.”
* “This is unsustainable.”
* “We’re absorbing too much horror and too much harm, and can’t stop it.”

Some volunteers want $500/month instead of the small thank-you stipends you currently offer
while others want actual staff positions. Some want better boundaries like less responsibility,
clearer expectations, the right to say no without guilt. Others are demanding mental health
resources and training on trauma-informed organizing practices.

The defiant optimistic energy needed for community growth is draining away. Without these
people, your community dies. They are irreplaceable in the way that humans are irreplaceable:
they know the culture, they've built relationships, they can sense when something is going off
the rails or where there is a unique opportunity. But your volunteer budget is $25,000 – you
can’t give everyone what they’re asking for.

**How do you redesign volunteer relationships to be sustainable?**

## More to Come

I'm presenting this document without commentary to keep the focus on the scenario.

I have a lot of other thoughts about the situation that I'll be posting about soon, so if you are interested in  that, please subscribe.
