[MovieLens](https://movielens.org)

It is a research project at the University of Minnesota using collaborative filtering. It's also [open dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/), so I know that I am helping researchers develop new recommendation engines that don't just get locked up in some closed database somewhere.

Lastly, it's ad-free and it's easy to import ratings from IMDB and to export it from MovieLens.
