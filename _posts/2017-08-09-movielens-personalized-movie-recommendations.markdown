Hey all,

I was looking for a good tool to use to review movies and then have that tool provide movie recommendations back on what to watch next. I know Netflix does something like this, but the recommendations are obviously restricted to just the movies available on Netflix.

Did a few searches on Reddit, and it looks like over time people use various new websites and apps as they were launched, but no general consensus on which might be best.

What do you use, and why?

[MovieLens](https://movielens.org)

It is a research project at the University of Minnesota using collaborative filtering. It's also [open dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/), so I know that I am helping researchers develop new recommendation engines that don't just get locked up in some closed database somewhere.

Lastly, it's ad-free and it's easy to import ratings from IMDB and to export it from MovieLens.
