<div class="self-post-content" markdown="1">
I am several days into a trial of switching to Firefox from Chrome, still not sure if I will stick with it or not. To help me decide, I've been making a list of pros and cons. Currently my list of pros for Firefox is:

* DuckDuckGo bang searches are sweet
* Firefox follows Linux window decorations and fonts better
* Firefox closes down more reliably and starts up quicker
* Pocket integration
* Left nav tabs are possible

Anything cool features to add to the list?

* Sidebar API makes it easy for you to dock extensions or bookmarks.
* Containers (including temporary ones) allowing you to separate identities (even for the same site)
* full open source project
* daily builds available
* more customizable
