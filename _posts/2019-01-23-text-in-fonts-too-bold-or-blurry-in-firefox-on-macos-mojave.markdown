# Original Post

>Hello Dear Firefox Community!
>
>Since the last update of Firefox Developer Edition to v66.0b1 (64Bit) on macOS Mojave I've got a weird problem: It looks like the browser shifts the font-weight definition up on every website for one step. So what used to be 200 is now 300, 300 is 400 and so on. When I roll back to the previous version everything works fine again. Looks like the font rendering is broken since the update.

My other regular Firefox installation (stable, v64.0.2) on the same devices also still work as expected, so I don't think it's an OS related issue, especially because I can fix it by rolling back one FF Dev version.

## My Comments

It looks like this is the issue - but it looks like it is a [*fix*](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1495282 "Some fonts are lighter weight after updating from macOS 10.13 to 10.14 Mojave").

Have you played with any of the font smoothing settings in Mojave? I know there were changes around that. Also, it may be significant if you are on an external high DPI display vs. one built in to a Mac.

This fixes a bug in Firefox. Compare the text to Safari - Firefox is respecting your platform setting instead of doing its own thing. 

Most Mac users want that. 

You can [disable font smoothing](https://blog.macsales.com/46527-is-macos-mojave-making-some-fonts-blurry-heres-how-to-fix-it) if you prefer that look.

FYI, if you are on a non-retina display, you will need to wait until Firefox 66 for a further fix (I guess developers are mostly on laptops with high DPI).

### Context

In the macOS Mojave 10.14 release, Apple [removed support for subpixel anti-aliasing](https://mjtsai.com/blog/2018/07/13/macos-10-14-mojave-removes-subpixel-anti-aliasing/) but kept "dilation" (bolding) for standard pixel density displays. Concurrently, the Firefox 2D rendering code ([Skia](https://skia.org/)) included a bug that [disabled gamma conversion](https://skia.googlesource.com/skia/+/16d00eeef7d18dcfd28725bcb4c15dad633ab7eb%5E%21/#F0), making fonts look thinner.

Mozilla shipped a fix for this in Firefox 66 to match the platform vendor (Apple).

This was a platform change, so users differed on which behavior they ended up preferring; while many users seemed to gravitate towards disabling font smoothing, on my low-DPI MacBook Air running Catalina, I still have font smoothing enabled. Clearly, Apple wants its customers on high-DPI displays, however -- with [fewer hacks](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17477526) for making text look better on lower DPI displays.
