I have often extolled the virtues of running [Nightly and Beta](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/channel/desktop/) versions of Firefox since it helps you to never be surprised about changes coming to Firefox, and to have a front row seat to providing feedback about new changes as they are still in development.

Another instance just happened today, and it is instructive, so here is a story:

[u/202nine](https://www.reddit.com/user/202nine/) posted on r/firefox that `browser.link.open_newwindow` set to **1** stopped working as they expected. That was yesterday. 

[u/panoptigram](https://www.reddit.com/user/panoptigram/) then posted that it was removed/changed. 

I then suggested that u/202nine could file a bug to report a regression, which they did: [Links are opening new windows despite browser.link.open_newwindow being set to 1](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1663500).

**Today, the change was reverted.**  Regression and fix, all within a day or so. 

If u/202nine hadn't been running Nightlies and filed a bug, that removal may have stayed in place to release, where people would undoubtedly complained about feature removal.

*If you are playing with advanced options, you owe it to yourself to run nightly, or at the very least, beta.* Not doing so is saying that you don't really care if the options go away.
