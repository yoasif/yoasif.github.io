>When is it planned to come out?

You can watch the issues on [GitHub](https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues).

You can already download builds, but they aren't very good yet.

You can download a non-updating build from [Taskcluster](https://tools.taskcluster.net/index/project.mobile.fenix.staging-signed-nightly.nightly/latest).
