# Original Post

>I've recently changed my Windows 7 system font size to 110%.
>
>I notice Chrome and IE don't apply the system size, and continue to display the base font at 16px, the browser default. This is the way I prefer it for development.
>
>But Firefox (and Dev edition) apply the system font size to the base size for all text. Consequently the pages render at 110% of the actual font size setting.
>
>Is there a setting I can use to force Firefox to use 16px or to prevent it inheriting the system font size?

## My Comments

Setting `layout.css.devPixelsPerPx` to **1.0** should give you what you want.
