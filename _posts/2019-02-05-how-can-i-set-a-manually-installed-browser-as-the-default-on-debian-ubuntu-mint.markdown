# Original Post

>Hi
>
>I am trying to set my Firefox developer as default in GNU/Linux, But I am stuck. Firefox Dev didn't shows up in `sudo update-alternatives --config x-www-browser`. In some app I have set them manually, but it's painful to set to every app, since they read the default value in my system. I don't use desktop environment so `.desktop` didn't work for me.
