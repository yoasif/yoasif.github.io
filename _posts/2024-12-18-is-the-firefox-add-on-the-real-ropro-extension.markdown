# Original Post

> So I know that the firefox ropro extension got removed. But I saw this extension recently on the firefox addons page that seems to be the real ropro. But there is only 31 users and all of the 10 reviews are from 2 days ago. Is this the legit one or a fake?

## My Comments

According to the add-on listing:

>Important Note: RoPro - Upgrade your Roblox is a third party Firefox add-on, we are not affiliated with Roblox or the RoPro Chrome extension.
