> I was wondering if anyone could point me in the direction of some resources to get me started contributing to OSM. I recently discovered OSM and have found it is much better than Google Maps, however there are some parts of the bike path that are not part of OSM yet and I would like to add them. Thank you for any help!

If you just want to edit as soon as possible, visit [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org), zoom to an area, and click "edit". (You'll need an account first). The editor has a built-in guide that will explain the basics. You can also click the built-in "help" button at any time.
