> I was wondering if anyone could point me in the direction of some resources to get me started contributing to OSM. I recently discovered OSM and have found it is much better than Google Maps, however there are some parts of the bike path that are not part of OSM yet and I would like to add them. Thank you for any help!

If you just want to edit as soon as possible, visit [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org), zoom to an area, and click "edit". (You'll need an account first). The editor has a built-in guide that will explain the basics. You can also click the built-in "help" button at any time.

### Context

I have long been interested in the "wisdom of the crowds" and open data, so I have been [mapping](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/yoasif) on OpenStreetMap on and off since 2014. I hope that one day, people can rely on fully offline, useful maps for day to day activities around their neighborhoods and during travel - a sort of [*Hitchhiker's Guide*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hitchhiker%27s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy).

Today, while I continue to map on the OSM website, I use [StreetComplete](https://streetcomplete.app/) most often while on the go - if you have an Android device, I highly recommend it (even if you don't have one - Android devices can be had extremely cheap, and the app works offline). 

While less pleasant to use, if you want to edit [POIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_of_interest) on the go, [Every Door](https://f-droid.org/packages/info.zverev.ilya.every_door/) works well enough for a quick edit - edit whether a location has a bathroom or vegan options on the menu.

I have never been an iOS user, so I am less familiar with options on that OS - I most often recommend that friends use [MapComplete](https://mapcomplete.org/) while on the go. Unfortunately, [this does not work offline](https://github.com/pietervdvn/MapComplete/issues/2111), in case you don't have a mobile data connection to the internet.

OpenStreetMap is awesome, and it is extremely gratifying to see your changes show up on apps like [Organic Maps](https://organicmaps.app/) and [Apple Maps](https://www.apple.com/maps/). Ensuring that organizations that you care about are represented on the map ([put them on the map](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/put%20%28something%20or%20someone%29%20on%20the%20mapgit)!) can be a form of [digital activism](https://mastodon.social/@yoasif/112944642638540978) -- so get mapping!
