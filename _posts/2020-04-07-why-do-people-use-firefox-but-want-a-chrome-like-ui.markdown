> For the people who are using Firefox but want UI to be like Chrome, why are they here?

Not everything is so black and white. I have used:

* [Netscape 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Navigator_2)
* [NeoPlanet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeoPlanet)
* [iCab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICab)
* [Internet Explorer 5 (Mac)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_for_Mac)
* [Mozilla Suite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Application_Suite)
* [Phoenix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox_early_version_history)
* Firefox
* [Camino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camino_(web_browser))
* Safari/[WebKit Nightly](https://webkit.org/blog/29/nightly-builds/)

and there were various things I liked about all of those browsers over the years. 

I think for some people, Firefox is the "super customizable browser", but to me it is the "small, fast, light alternative to Mozilla with better standards support than anything out there". Camino was that with a really nice Mac UI but without any extensions (which really held it back for me). 

Safari was the incredibly fast standards compliant browser with a great UI, but again, lacking extensions. 

Chrome has an almost too-simple UI, but the UI they have is generally pretty high quality. It is also a heavy browser that doesn't handle tab abuse well, doesn't integrate that well into Windows or Linux (what is with the weird font smoothing on Windows, for example?) and worst of all, is bad for the web, because they don't care about the standards process. 

Some people like Mozilla because they play fair, do a good job, and it meets their needs. Doesn't necessarily mean they think the UI is perfect or that they think that [userChrome](https://www.userchrome.org/) or legacy add-ons is what makes Firefox special.
