> Opera did it. Is opera bigger company then Mozilla. Mozilla also have community behind. Now opera works very very stable. Most of my friends use opera.

Opera is a shell of its previous self and is [making money by offering predatory loans in developing nations](https://www.engadget.com/2020-01-19-opera-accused-of-predatory-loan-apps.html). Opera isn't a great example of how any company should operate, let alone a browser company.
