In a continuation of Mozilla's [Terms of Use disaster]({% post_url 2025-03-05-the-mozilla-firefox-new-terms-of-use-disaster-what-actually-happened %}), [Mima-sama](https://makai.chaotic.ninja/@mima) [alerted me to the fact that Mozilla's blog post contains an error](https://makai.chaotic.ninja/notes/a50h2covei) when referencing the CCPA -- it seems that Mozilla is quoting from a draft that contains a [drafting error](https://iapp.org/news/a/ccpa-cpras-hidden-third-party-business-classification/#:~:text=Yes%2C%20the%20definition%20of%20'sale'%20has%20a%20drafting%20error).

The [incorrect](https://archive.ph/hih9O) text:

> “Sell,” “selling,” “sale,” or “sold,” means selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer’s personal information by the business to <del>another business or</del> a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration.

The [correct](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=CIV&sectionNum=1798.140.#:~:text=%E2%80%9Csale) copy:

> “Sell,” “selling,” “sale,” or "sold," means selling, renting, releasing, disclosing, disseminating, making available, transferring, or otherwise communicating orally, in writing, or by electronic or other means, a consumer’s personal information by the business to a third party for monetary or other valuable consideration.

I don't know how much this changes things; we don't really know whether the new ToU is a response to the CCPA, or something else -- and whether the language change here would change Mozilla's legal counsel's opinion of their data practices.
