>I cannot see history items that I visited a long time ago. Is this a bug or some config thing?

Sync history is 60 days per [mconnor](https://blog.mozilla.org/services/2011/06/15/enabling-quotas-for-firefox-sync/#comment-100):

>However, Sync does not actually keep all of your history on the server, just the sites visited in the last 60 days, so this change wonâ€™t impact quota usage.
