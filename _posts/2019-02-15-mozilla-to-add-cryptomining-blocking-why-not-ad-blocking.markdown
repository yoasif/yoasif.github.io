> Why does society tolerate obnoxious ads? Because they are a monetisation model for websites.

Mozilla agrees.

> They are one of leading causes, if not THE leading cause of violated privacy over the internet via tracking.

Mozilla agrees.

This is the reason that Mozilla isn't blocking ads but is working to defuse trackers in Firefox - it believes that ads are a legitimate monetization engine for the web, but thinks that tracking is not.

As far as cryptomining, my feeling is that it may simply be because if Mozilla doesn't do it, people will think Firefox slows down their machine/heats up their machine/lowers their battery life and won't want to use it.

It is a balance, and my guess is that Mozilla just thinks that the trade-off isn't worth it.
