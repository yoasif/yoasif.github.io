I've been playing with this for a little while today and I came up with one step encode:

`ffmpeg -i %s -map 0:0 -b:a %bk -codec:a libopus -vbr on -f ogg -`

Hope it is helpful to anyone stopping by this thread. 

Also using it on FLAC to Opus (using ogg as "convert to"):

`opusenc --vbr --bitrate 192 --downmix-stereo %s -`

works well too.
