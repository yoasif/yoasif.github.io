[Classic Mac OS "Drawing Board" theme inspired theme](https://color.firefox.com/?theme=XQAAAAL6AAAAAAAAAABBqYhm849SCiazH1KEGccwS-xNVAWBvR_gsLBrbfOzBFepDYlSaIRlSbSraTJI0jFibNj3AtCnXeBjj09z2AqymzaDMLhMlpMIz65-WAdyl421pKY89PV2RIpUszP0ZjvdMFk9cbVTbJOF3cakCo_xXkE39lG18Zi-y4w0xlI0JZfBrXpanXf-qMVvc6opUUpHBRh0iyQ3rur2ciozZFjv8g0WIGvH-5YeAA)

### Context

When Mozilla [introduced the Firefox Color Test Pilot experiment](https://medium.com/firefox-test-pilot/introducing-firefox-color-and-side-view-20fa66c01ff4), I excitedly played around with it and ended up creating a fascimile of the unreleased [Classic Mac OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classic_Mac_OS) [Appearance Manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appearance_Manager) theme "[Drawing Board](https://aleclikesmacintosh.tumblr.com/post/144720166662/drawing-board-theme-in-mac-os9)" ([mirror]({{site.url}}/assets/images/drawing-board/tumblr_o4qidstZJd1trm5lxo1_1280.jpg)).

I have always loved retro-computing UIs and themes, and this particular theme was clearly too pretty to be released by Apple. Hope you enjoy it!
