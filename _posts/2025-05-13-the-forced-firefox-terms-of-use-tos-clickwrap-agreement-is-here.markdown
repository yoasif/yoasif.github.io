When Mozilla [announced their Terms of Use a few months ago]({% post_url 2025-03-05-the-mozilla-firefox-new-terms-of-use-disaster-what-actually-happened %}), they told us that they would be [asking us to acknowledge](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/firefox/firefox-terms-of-use/) it at a later date. That day is here, and I took a quick look at it.

They started enforcing their new [ToS for new users](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1959542), starting with version 138.0.3.

I made a video walking through it.

	</a>

At first launch, you are greeted with a modal dialog describing the purpose of the ToS, along with a "Continue" button and some expandable sections. No cancel button -- there is no way to opt out of agreeing to the clickwrap agreement.

Conveniently, while you must agree to the overall relationship you have with Mozilla, you can easily opt out of data collection in Firefox - that option is hidden behind the last section, labeled "Manage diagnostic and interaction data".

</p>

Data collection is enabled by default, [as it has been for years]({% post_url 2025-03-12-mozilla-has-been-sharing-aggregated-firefox-data-with-advertisers-since-2017-when-it-enabled-telemetry-by-default %}).

I've been working on a tutorial to help people use policies.json to manage their Firefox installs, now that this ToS clickwrap is live. 

Stay tuned for that, and thanks for reading!
