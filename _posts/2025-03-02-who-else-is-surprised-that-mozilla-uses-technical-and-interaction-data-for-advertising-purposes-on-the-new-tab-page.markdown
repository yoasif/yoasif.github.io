[Mozilla's legal updates from last week]({% post_url 2025-02-26-mozillas-new-terms-of-use-are-out-of-step-with-firefoxs-direct-competition %}) are the gift that keep on giving.

I first saw that Mozilla said that users can opt out of having their data processed for advertising purposes by turning off a setting related to "technical and interaction data‚Äù in [TechCrunch coverage of the new terms](https://techcrunch.com/2025/02/28/mozilla-responds-to-backlash-over-new-terms-saying-its-not-using-peoples-data-for-ai/). I initially disbelieved what I had read, thinking that it must be in error - so I [responded to the reporter asking for clarification](https://mastodon.social/@yoasif/114082976581721155) üò≥.

Clearly, I should have looked at the Privacy Notice before posting üòî. 

#### Extract from the Firefox Privacy Notice

I was so sure that there was no way that the setting related to "technical and interaction data‚Äù was connected to data processed for advertising, that I surprised myself when reading the Privacy Notice.

My immediate reaction was that is incredibly unintuitive: Mozilla is using data that it has access to only because I want to help Firefox *development* -- for **advertising**. 

I did some quick testing, and found that you can disable the sharing of "technical and interaction data‚Äù and still receive ads on the New Tab page. It seems that opting to not assist Firefox technical development grants users additional privacy from advertising. *This is completely surprising to me.*

I [want to help Mozilla build Firefox](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/user_profile?user_id=347239), so I have always had this setting enabled.

Am I reading this wrong?

## Feedback

### Mozilla was upfront about this / <abbr title="read the fucking manual">RTFM</abbr>

You might respond that Mozilla was [upfront](https://lemmy.dbzer0.com/comment/17032600) about this preference.

I admit that I didn't look deeply into this before posting, but I looked after I got this feedback.

On the [Content recommendations on the Firefox New Tab page - FAQ](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/new-tab#w_data-and-privacy)[^1], Mozilla says:

> **Is data collected when I interact with New Tab recommendations, and what controls do I have?**
>
>By default, when stories are recommended on your [New Tab page](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/about-new-tab-page), Firefox collects data on how often they appear and how many times they are clicked. This data is not linked to any technical or interaction information about you or your Firefox browser. You can learn more about the [data we collect](https://github.com/mozilla/activity-stream/blob/master/docs/v2-system-addon/data_events.md) and [opt out data collection](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/share-data-mozilla-help-improve-firefox) if you prefer.
>
>If you choose topics of interest to personalize your recommendations, the selected topics will be collected to improve the relevance of the recommended articles and sponsored content on your New Tab page. This information is also not associated with any technical or interaction data about you or your Firefox browser. 

On [Sponsored shortcuts on the New Tab page](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/sponsor-privacy#w_what-data-is-shared)[^2], Mozilla says:

> **What data is shared?**
>
> When you view or click on a sponsored shortcut, Firefox sends [anonymized technical data](https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/firefox/#recommend-relevant-content) to our partner through a Mozilla-owned proxy service. The code for this proxy service is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/mozilla/gcp-ingestion) for interested technical audiences. This data does not include any personally identifying information and is only shared when you click on a sponsored shortcut.

I don't see any reference on the help pages linked above to the new recommendation [provided on the privacy notice](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/privacy/firefox/#notice:~:text=products%20and%20services%29.-,You%20can%20read%20more%20information%20about%20how%20to%20manage%20your%20New%20Tab%20page%20including%20your%20data%20settings.%20You%20can%20opt%20out%20of%20having%20your%20data%20processed%20for%20personalization%20or%20advertising%20purposes%20by%20turning%20off%20%E2%80%9Ctechnical%20and%20interaction%20data%E2%80%9D%20on%20Desktop%20and%20Mobile%20at%20any%20time.,-To%20provide%20Mozilla) to turn off the setting related to "technical and interaction data".

On the contrary, in both cases, Mozilla is seemingly telling us that NTP interactions are explicitly *not* linked to Firefox technical and interaction data (*my* **emphasis** added):

> By default, when stories are recommended on your [New Tab page](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/about-new-tab-page), Firefox collects data on how often they appear and how many times they are clicked. **This data is not linked to any technical or interaction information about you or your Firefox browser.**

Here, Mozilla says that interactions with stories displayed on the New Tab page are **"not linked to any technical or interaction information about you or your Firefox browser"**. What this is saying seems pretty self evident - Mozilla is saying that New Tab story data is not linked to "technical or interaction" information - they even use the exact words that appear in the UI (and in the Privacy Notice).

> When you view or click on a sponsored shortcut, Firefox sends [anonymized technical data](https://www.mozilla.org/privacy/firefox/#recommend-relevant-content) to our partner through a Mozilla-owned proxy service. The code for this proxy service is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/mozilla/gcp-ingestion) for interested technical audiences. **This data does not include any personally identifying information and is only shared when you click on a sponsored shortcut.**

Mozilla says that data about interactions with sponsored shortcuts are **"only shared when you click on a sponsored shortcut"** via a Mozilla-owned proxy service. There is no mention here of *linking* that data with personally identifiable information ("technical and interaction data" is personally identifiable), and Mozilla even says that "this data is ... only shared when you click" -- Firefox telemetry data is not sent on demand!

As far as I can tell, Firefox help was not upfront about this, but please correct me with any additional references to documentation.

### "Technical and interaction data" is not personally identifiable

In the [figure above](#extract-from-the-firefox-privacy-notice), Mozilla states that "unique identifiers" are processed to serve ads.

### Ads are optional / You can use a blank new tab

I know that ads are optional. I just don't expect that after sharing technical and interaction data to help improve Firefox, that Mozilla would turn around and monetize that technical data by linking it to advertising data in ways that Mozilla [specifically disclaims](#mozilla-was-upfront-about-this--rtfm) in their documentation.
