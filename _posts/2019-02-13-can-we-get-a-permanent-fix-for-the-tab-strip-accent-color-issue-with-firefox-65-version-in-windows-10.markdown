Have you tried disabling your accent color in Windows?

>That's the whole point, I like the accent color in other windows like File Explorer etc, but in Firefox I prefer dark mode. I don't want to turn off the accent color in Windows.

Watch bug id [1504766](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1504766 "Explicit Dark and Light themes (!= Default theme in OS dark mode) shouldn't honor Windows 10 setting for accent color in title bars") and good luck.
