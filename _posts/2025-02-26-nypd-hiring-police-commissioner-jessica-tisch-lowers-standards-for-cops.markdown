>Seeking to recruit more officers, [NYPD Commissioner Jessica Tisch announced on Wednesday morning a dramatic reduction in the department‚Äôs college credit requirements](https://www.amny.com/police-fire/nypd-tisch-reduces-college-credit-requirements/) for candidate cops.

>The main crux of Tisch‚Äôs strategy is immediately lowering the number of college credits needed to become an officer from 60 to 24; that impacts more than 5,000 candidates on 29 active civil service lists who were previously ineligible to join the NYPD. Police officials hope that this will attract more applicants and increase the ranks.

>‚ÄúWe are still seeing the very real impact of the defund and anti-police movement. A lot of the rhetoric aimed at our police is vile, and the pendulum has swung too far away from what I consider to be the most important and noble job one could do,‚Äù Tisch said.

I'm sure putting less educated cops on the street will *improve* public perceptions. üôÑ
