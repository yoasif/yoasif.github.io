The [Facebook container](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/facebook-container/) makes it so that links clicked on Facebook that lead off site don't use the Facebook container anymore. The regular [multi account container add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/) will keep clicked links inside of the Facebook container.

For that reason, I think it is useful to have both installed.
