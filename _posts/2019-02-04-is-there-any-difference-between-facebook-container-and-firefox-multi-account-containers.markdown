Example: If I make a container just for Facebook, nothing else it will work the same way of Facebook Container? I tried to use both but it seems Facebook Container assume over Multi-Account Containers.

I'm asking this because of the new "addon recomendation" feature on the last update keeps recommending Facebook Container even if I use Facebook on a unique container.

Edit: thanks for the replies!

The [Facebook container](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/facebook-container/) makes it so that links clicked on Facebook that lead off site don't use the Facebook container anymore. The regular [multi account container add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/) will keep clicked links inside of the Facebook container.

For that reason, I think it is useful to have both installed.
