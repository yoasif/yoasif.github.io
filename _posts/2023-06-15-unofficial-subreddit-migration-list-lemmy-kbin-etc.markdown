A comprehensive mapping of old subreddits to new communities.

* * *

With /r/startrek [moving to Lemmy](https://www.reddit.com/r/startrek/comments/14a5t8w/looking_for_an_alternative_to_reddit_to_talk_trek/), I realized that Redditors are going to need a way to find their old communities on Lemmy/Kbin.

Here's a quick and dirty list that you can [contribute to](https://github.com/yoasif/yoasif.github.io/blob/main/_posts/2023-06-15-unofficial-subreddit-migration-list-lemmy-kbin-etc.markdown). Put new entries in alphabetical order. Pull requests welcome!

##### Updates
{:.no_toc}

2023-06-20 - Added a "[scab](#scab-subreddits)" subreddits section, as this will be important as teams are [broken apart]({% post_url 2023-06-18-reddit-is-sowing-division-in-mod-teams-because-protest-is-working %} "Unofficial Subreddit Migration List (Lemmy, Kbin)") and I continue to track endorsements by former moderators.
