# Original Post

> I wasn't really thinking and deleted Firefox Preview Nightly due to the constant crashing and downloaded Firefox Preview. I never thought about my Collections, which I had several. Will they sync or are they gone forever? Might I get them back if I reinstall Firefox Preview Nightly?

## My Comments

They are gone forever. There is a bug filed for this: <https://github.com/mozilla-mobile/fenix/issues/4424>

Sorry about your experience.

>Oh, it's a bug? So there is a chance I can get them back if that's fixed?

More of a missing feature. And no, your collections are gone. Sorry.

### Context

As of 2024, collections do not sync, and there is no way to export them. I personally do not use them and they seem to be a bit of a forgotten/ignored feature on Firefox for Android.
