<div class="self-post-content" markdown="1">

Firefox recently announced they were removing support for RSS. Among other reasons, it was said this feature could be better supported by extensions, was rarely used, and wasn't worth the code maintenance and bloat.

Personally, I love this decision.

Along the same lines, I think they should stop spending valuable development time on features like (1) tracking protection (2) password managers (3) pdf readers, (4) "new tab" features (5) etc.

These are all services that could be (or already are) provided through far superior services than what Firefox offers natively.

In doing so, Firefox would be smaller, more efficient, have fewer bugs, and so forth.

With all that precious development time saved, they could instead focus on making the browser a better experience for each OS.

For mac users, I'm thinking things like:

- Pinch to zoom

- "Bounce effect" on scrolling to the top/bottom of a page

- Touch bar support

- Performance enhancements (so I can use my computer for more than an hour off battery and my fan doesn't sound like a get engine...)

- and so on.

All just a matter of my opinion though :)

I think platform specific code is worth doing, especially since the Mac forks like [Camino are dead](https://caminobrowser.org/), and browsers like [Epiphany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Web) no longer use Gecko.

Firefox shouldn't ask users to give up platform conventions for their browser, especially since a browser is a large part of what many users do on their machines nowadays.
