I think platform specific code is worth doing, especially since the Mac forks like [Camino are dead](https://caminobrowser.org/), and browsers like [Epiphany](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNOME_Web) no longer use Gecko.

Firefox shouldn't ask users to give up platform conventions for their browser, especially since a browser is a large part of what many users do on their machines nowadays.
