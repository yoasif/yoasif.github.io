You can find Mozilla's recommended add-ons [on AMO](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/search/?recommended=true&type=extension).

## Add-ons by purpose

### Ad blocking

**[SponsorBlock](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/sponsorblock/)** (**⭐ Open Source** **🏆 Recommended by Mozilla**) will skip over sponsored segments, intros and more in YouTube videos.

### Dark Mode

**[Dark Background and Light Text](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/dark-background-light-text/)** (**⭐ Open Source** **🏆 Recommended by Mozilla**) A simple extension which makes website backgrounds black and text white.

### Container Add-ons

**[Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/)** (**⭐ Open Source** **🏆 Recommended by Mozilla**) allows for the easy creation of containers and can force a website to always open in a container. Made by Mozilla.

## Add-ons to replace features you may be used to

### In page translation

Many Chrome users miss the Google translate feature built into Chrome that automatically detects a foreign language web page and offers to translate it. There are decent translation add-ons available for Firefox.

**[Firefox Translate](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/firefox-translations/)** (**⭐ Open Source**) Translate the web without the cloud.

**[Page Translator Revised](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/page-translator-revised/)** (**⭐ Open Source**) This add-on allows you to choose between Microsoft Translator and Google Translate, and you can also automatically translate pages once you visit a foreign language page. When translating pages, the translated page opens in a new tab. 

**[Translate Web Pages](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/traduzir-paginas-web/)** (**⭐ Open Source**) This add-on allows you to choose between Yandex and Google Translate. You can also automatically translate pages once you visit a foreign language page, and the extension can also translate selected text on pages.

### Set Tabs Aside

Microsoft Edge had a set tabs aside feature that made it easy to hide tabs and have a clean window to help you focus. You can use **[Set Aside Tabs](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/set-aside-tabs/)** to get this feature in Firefox.

### Search Google for image

If you miss being able to search by image, there are many add-ons that can help you. Here are two that allow you to search by image:

**[Search by Image](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/search_by_image/)** This add-on has many built in engines, and many options. The interface may be a bit heavyweight for some (it adds a toolbar icon, but that can be removed in Firefox). If you enable more than one engine, they appear in a sub-menu, and you can open them all at once in the background if you prefer. 

**[Reverse Image Search](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/image-reverse-search/)** Very similar to the one above, except that it allows you to add your own engines. If you enable more than one engine, they appear in a sub-menu, and you can open them all at once in the background if you prefer. 

**[Image Search Options](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/image-search-options/)** Set of highly customizable reverse image search context menu options.

### Sync bookmarks with Chromium browsers

A lot of people want to switch over, but they may want to keep their bookmarks in sync, in case they want to use a Chromium browser for certain sites or on occasion. 

[**xBrowserSync**](https://www.xbrowsersync.org) is a cross browser extension for [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/xbs/) and [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xbrowsersync/lcbjdhceifofjlpecfpeimnnphbcjgnc). It is encrypted end to end and doesn't require a sign up.

### Paste and Go

Vivaldi users may miss the **Control+Shift+v** shortcut to paste and go to a URL. [**Paste and Go Key**](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/paste-and-go-key/) brings this feature to Firefox.

Paste and Go in built right into the address bar as a right-click mechanism.

### Hover Zoom

The Firefox version of this popular enlarge on hover extension has issue. [**Imagus**](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/imagus/) is a good alternative.
